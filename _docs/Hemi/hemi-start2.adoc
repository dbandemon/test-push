## WHAT IS HEMI?

### Problem Statement

 

Many of our OptumRx digital systems are experiencing lack luster performance and availiability/reliability issues related to the aging architecture of some of our legacy backend systems and complicated middleware layers.

 

### HEMI Objectives

 

Build a cloud-based content and integration platform that unlocks data for consuming applications on digital and marketing channels adhering to Optum standards of Security, Availability, Reliability and Performance.

### High Level Aspirations

 

* Public Cloud first design and deployment

* A common point of consumption for standard data avoids extensive replication of data workloads

* Provide Content and Data as a Service

* Common, high-performance data access streamlines and accelerates digital portal TTV, speed, and quality

 

[HEMI FAQs]

 

## Is HEMI something for me...

 

* Are your consumers suffering from poor performance?

* Is the reliability of your system less than what you would like?

* Are you unsure how to move off of an aging technology stack?

* Does your application need to share data with other applications?

* Do you offer services that are needed by other applications that may be duplicates of other services existing in the company?

* Do you want to "unlock" data contained in your system, but are not sure how to do it?

 

Then maybe HEMI or some of HEMI patterns may be something for you...

 

 

## Architecture Guiding Principles

## High Level Reference Architecture

 

### Overall Architecture Goals

* Cache data needed by our digital systems in the cloud in a de-normalized "easy to access" format.

* Stream changes in this data from the source/legacy systems real-time to the cloud.

* Transform the streaming data into an enriched HCP canonical format for consistency and standardization across systems.

* Provide new reusable microservices than encapsulate all runtime processing for a specific function into a single microservice.

* Group HEMI microservices into functional domains that share nothing to support loose coupling between domains.

* Construct our processes in a way that leverages the advantages of the cloud including managed services, IaaS, automation, auto-scaling, multi-region, etc.

* Automate everything

### Streaming Reference Architecture

* Unified and Centralized source of truth as Raw Streams from backend systems

* Flexibility to have dedicated canonical model and transformation rules by consumers

* Independent canonical streams that can be subscribed across eco-systems

* Optimized operational cost across cross functional business units

* Single talent pool which owns, operates and enhances the data federation roadmap
